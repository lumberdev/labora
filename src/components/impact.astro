        Tom Mackie, our founder, taught his kids grandkids and great grandkids a
        simple approach to finances…

        With our family foundations, we aim to maximize the potential of as many
        families and individuals as possible and provide them with the
        opportunity to thrive. We do this by focusing our efforts in the areas
        of poverty alleviation, children’s health, mental health, and community.
        We also invest in the visual arts to help provide universal access to
        the shared knowledge and creativity that comes from art exploration.
